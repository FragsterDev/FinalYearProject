# 🏔️ Landslide Detection and Risk Mapping using Deep Learning (U-Net) and Landslide4Sense

A deep learning pipeline to detect landslides from satellite imagery using the [U-Net](w) architecture trained on the [Landslide4Sense](w) dataset. The detected results are further integrated with [Google Earth Engine](w) to generate landslide **risk maps** for geospatial analysis and early warning systems.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- 🔍 **Dataset**: [Landslide4Sense](w) — labeled satellite imagery for landslide regions.
- 🧠 **Model**: U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation.
- 🛰️ **Risk Mapping**: Post-inference results used to generate georeferenced risk maps using Google Earth Engine (GEE).
- 📊 **Evaluation**: Metrics like IoU, F1-score, and accuracy to validate model performance.
- 🌍 **Application**: Disaster risk mitigation, early warning systems, urban planning.
